This directory contains some effort to describe and explain all TrbNet
Registers in a human-readable way, including some "annotations" how to
read/write them efficiently.

The XML database can then serve as a default configuration (protected
by SHA1 hash?), on which personal modifications can build upon.

Some envisaged use cases:

1) trbcmd-pretty -> Have a look at the content of registers without
reading "raw" hex values

2) Save/Load TRB config in XML format (as diff to "default" database)

3) Automatically create configuration for third-party monitoring (e.g.
EPICS)
