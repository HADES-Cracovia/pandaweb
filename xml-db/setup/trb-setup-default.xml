  <!-- also note the different uses of the address attribute:
       sometimes it's a register address, sometimes a trbnet endpoint
       address, or sometimes it specifies the chain number of the
       external PaDiWa frontend -->

      <!-- this way we modify the number of channels to 5. This works
           since group/register/memory/fifo have unique names. It
           might be that there are several places where one should
           change the "repeat" to get a consistent entity model, but
           how does one know that programmitcally??? -->
