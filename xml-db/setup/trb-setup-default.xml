<description>A hypothetic TRB set-up that due to some strange coincidence exists in Mainz.</description>

  <!-- The order of the trb elements is respected and their content is
       evaluated after each one (if they specify a value). This is important if the resulting
       changes to the TrbNet must happen in a certain way. -->

  <!-- also note the different uses of the address attribute:
       sometimes it's a register address, sometimes a trbnet endpoint
       address, or sometimes it specifies the chain number of the
       external PaDiWa frontend -->

                
  <!-- this specifies the trbaddress from uid's, it can be omitted if
       the TrbNet is already set-up -->
